# Leaf-Classification
Leaf Classification project aimed to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying different types of leaves based on their visual characteristics. The project utilized a dataset consisting of images of various leaf specimens, along with corresponding labels indicating the leaf species.

The first step of the project involved data collection and preprocessing. A comprehensive dataset of leaf images was compiled, ensuring a diverse representation of different leaf species. The images were then processed to normalize the data and extract relevant features, such as shape, color, and texture, which would serve as input for the machine learning model.

Next, a suitable machine learning algorithm was selected for the classification task. Various algorithms, such as decision trees, random forests, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), were evaluated based on their performance metrics and ability to handle image data effectively. Ultimately, a CNN architecture was chosen due to its proven success in image classification tasks.

The selected CNN model was then trained using the preprocessed dataset. The dataset was split into training and validation sets to assess the model's performance and prevent overfitting. The model underwent multiple training iterations, adjusting hyperparameters and optimizing the training process to improve accuracy.

After training, the model was evaluated on a separate test set to assess its generalization capabilities and overall performance. The accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were calculated to measure the model's classification performance across various leaf species.

The Leaf Classification project achieved a high level of accuracy in identifying and classifying different leaf species. The trained model demonstrated robustness in handling various leaf images and accurately predicting their corresponding species. The project's outcomes have the potential to support botanical research, environmental monitoring, and automated plant identification systems.

The project's future enhancements could involve expanding the dataset to include a wider range of leaf species, improving the model's performance on rare or challenging leaf types, and deploying the model as a user-friendly application or integrating it into existing plant identification platforms.

Overall, the Leaf Classification project successfully developed a machine learning model capable of accurate leaf species classification, showcasing the potential for using artificial intelligence in automating and enhancing plant identification processes
